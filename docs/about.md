 This is [Ryan C. Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_C._Gordon), he is one of the juggernauts behind [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer). 

Ya know... 

SDL.

That low level library that **powers literally every commercial game engine out there?**![Ryan][ryan]

He's also worked on porting a number of games to Linux and Mac OS: such as Braid, Super Meat Boy, Dear Esther, and LIMBO.
#### Amir#

And this is [Amir Rajan](http://amirrajan.net/), he is an indie game dev with titles on iOS, Android, desktop, and Nintendo Switch... **amassing 4 million downloads and counting** ([Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/a-dark-room-switch/), [Kill Screen](https://killscreen.com/articles/ensign/), [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/a-dark-room-the-best-selling-game-that-no-one-can-explain)). And yes, all these games are built with the DragonRuby Runtime.

**Both of these guys hate the complexity of today's engines.** And as luck would have it, their paths ended up crossing. After six months and 50,000 lines of DragonRuby Runtime enhancements, Ryan and Amir now have a live/hot loadable, cruft-free, productive game engine that can target... well... any gaming device you can think of.
