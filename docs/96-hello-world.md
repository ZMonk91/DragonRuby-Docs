# Hello World Tutorial Pt. 1
By [Ryan 'The Juggernaut' Gordon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_C._Gordon)

Welcome!

Here's just a little push to get you started if you're new to programming or
game development.

If you want to write a game, it's no different than writing any other
program for any other framework: there are a few simple rules that might be
new to you, but more or less programming is programming no matter what you
are building.

Did you not know that? Did you think you couldn't write a game because you're
a "web guy" or you're writing Java at a desk job? Stop letting people tell
you that you can't, because you already have everything you need.

Here, we're going to be programming in a language called "Ruby." In the
interest of full disclosure, I (Ryan "The Juggernaut" Gordon) wrote the C
parts of this toolkit and Ruby looks a little strange to me (Amir Rajan wrote the
Ruby parts), but I'm going to walk you through the basics because we're all
learning together, and if you mostly think of yourself as someone that writes
C (or C++, C#, Objective-C), PHP, or Java, then you're only a step behind me right now.

Here's the most important thing you should know: **Ruby lets you do some
complicated things really easily, and you can learn that stuff later. ** I'm
going to show you one or two cool tricks, but that's all.
