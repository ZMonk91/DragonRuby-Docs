# DragonRuby Game Toolkit


DragonRuby-GTK is a professional grade (yet beginner friendly) 2D game engine. It's tiny (~3MB), fast as hell, and cross-platform (including consoles).

## Features
  - Dirt simple apis capable of creating complex 2D games.
  - Fast as hell. Powered by highly optimized C code written by Ryan C. Gordon, the creator of SDL (a library that powers every commercial game engine in the world).
  - Battle tested by Amir Rajan, a critically acclaimed indie game dev.
  - Tiny. Like really tiny. The entire engine is a few megabytes.
  - Hot loaded, realtime coding, optimized to provide constant feedback to the dev.
  - Productive and an absolute joy to use.
  - Turn key builds for Windows, MacOS, and Linux with seamless publishing to Itch.io.
  - Cross platform: PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, XBOX One, and PS4 (mobile and console compilation requires a business entity, NDA verification, and a Professional GTK License, contact us).
